📘 Networking Basics – Summary Note

🔌 1. How Devices Communicate

All devices (phones, computers, servers) communicate by sending bits (0s and 1s).

To move data between devices, we use:

Cables → transport electrical/optical signals
Switches → connect devices inside the same local network (LAN)
Routers → connect different networks together using IP addresses

Internet Service Providers (ISP) → connect your home or phone to the global internet

🖧 2. Switch vs Router

Switch

Works with MAC addresses
Connects devices inside a single network (example: computers in one office or house)
Does NOT connect to the internet

Router

Works with IP addresses
Connects multiple networks together
Routes traffic to the correct destination

Your home router includes:

router + switch + WiFi radio (combined in one device)

“Router on top of Switch”

This means:

First a switch connects computers inside a small network
Then a router connects these networks to other networks (including the internet)
The router sits logically above switches in the network hierarchy

🌐 3. IP Addresses

IP address = like a home address for your device

Each device gets a unique IP

First part = network (like city)

Last part = host (like house number)

Used by routers to decide where to send data

Example:

192.168.1.5
↑ network  ↑ host

📡 4. 4G and 5G – What They Actually Do

4G and 5G are mobile network generations.

G = Generation

They provide wireless communication between:

📱 Your Mobile Phone ↔ Nearest Cell Tower

They transmit:

Internet data

Voice calls (VoLTE)

Messages

App data

They use radio waves, not cables, for this part.
🧵 5. There Is Always a Physical Connection

Even though your phone uses wireless signals:

Wireless part:

📱 Phone → (radio waves) → Cell Tower

Wired part:

Cell Tower → (fiber/underground cables) → ISP → Internet → Servers → Other devices

This is why we say there is always a physical connection somewhere in the path.

Your phone only avoids cables between you and the tower.
After the tower, everything travels through physical fiber cables.


🛰️ 7. How Your Phone Connects to the Internet

Your phone sends data to the cell tower using 4G/5G signals

Tower sends it through fiber cables to your ISP

ISP connects to the global internet

Data travels to websites, apps, or other people

Response returns the same way → tower → your phone

📘 Summary

Switch connects devices inside one network
Router connects different networks and the internet
IP address uniquely identifies devices
4G/5G handle the wireless part of communication
Real internet backbone = routers + switches + fiber cables
Wireless only covers phone ↔ tower
Everything else uses physical connections
