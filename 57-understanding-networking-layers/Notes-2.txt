🚀 FULL PRACTICAL WALK-THROUGH — how data actually moves through layers

📌 STEP 1 — You type www.google.com
 and press Enter

Your browser wants a webpage.

So your browser creates an HTTP Request:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com


This is JUST text.

This text starts at the Application Layer.

📦 LAYER 1: Application Layer (HTTP)

🟦 Data here = application data (e.g., HTTP request text)

Browser prepares the HTTP request.
It decides to send it using TCP/IP.
At this stage data looks like:

[HTTP DATA]


No IP, no MAC, no routing.
Just raw webpage request.

📦 LAYER 2: Transport Layer (TCP)

🟩 Data becomes a TCP segment
Transport layer adds TCP info:
Source port (random number, e.g., 50012)
Destination port (HTTPS = 443)
Sequence numbers
Error checking
Now data looks like:

[TCP HEADER][HTTP DATA]


TCP ensures:

Reliable delivery
Resending if lost
Ordered packets
This TCP segment must now be delivered to Google → for that we need IP addresses.

📦 LAYER 3: Network Layer (IP)

🟥 Data becomes an IP packet

Your network layer adds:
Source IP = your WiFi/router IP
Destination IP = Google’s server IP (e.g., 142.250.195.78)

Now:

[IP HEADER][TCP HEADER][HTTP DATA]


The IP layer decides:

Which route to take
Whether to send to router
How to move between networks
This IP packet MUST reach Google’s location (like addressing a letter with a country/city/house number).

📦 LAYER 4: Data Link Layer (Ethernet)

🟨 Data becomes a frame for local network delivery

This layer uses MAC addresses (physical addresses).

It adds:

Source MAC = your laptop MAC
Destination MAC = your router’s MAC (not Google!)
Because your laptop can only reach devices in your LAN.

Now it becomes:

[ETHERNET HEADER][IP HEADER][TCP HEADER][HTTP DATA]

📦 LAYER 5: Physical Layer

🟪 Converts the frame into electrical signals / radio waves
If you are on WiFi → radio waves
If using cable → voltage/light pulses
Every bit (0 or 1) becomes:

“there is signal” = 1

“no signal” = 0

Now the bits travel through the air/wire to your router.

🛣️ Now the data leaves your laptop → arrives at router

Your router receives the bits.
It moves UP the layers:

Physical → reconstructs bits
Data link → checks MAC, sees it is the destination
Network (IP) → sees destination IP = Google
Transport → keeps TCP segment intact
Sends packet to the next router on the internet
Your router does NOT read your HTTP data.
It only cares about IP addresses.

🌍 STEP 2 — Data travels through the Internet

Now the packet goes through multiple routers:
Router A → Router B → Router C → Undersea cable → Google data center router → Google server

At each hop:
Frame is removed and rebuilt
MAC changes each time (next hop MAC)
IP stays the same
TCP stays the same
HTTP data stays the same
The IP header guides the entire journey.

🖥️ STEP 3 — Packet reaches Google’s server

Google’s router sends packet to Google’s server.

Now inside the server:

Data goes UP the layers

Physical → Data Link → Network → Transport → Application

Let’s break it:

✔ Physical Layer

Converts signals back into bits.

✔ Data Link Layer

Reads MAC

Passes packet upward

✔ Network Layer

Reads destination IP

Confirms it is for this server’s IP

Passes it up

✔ Transport Layer (TCP)

Reassembles segments

Ensures no missing segments

Gives clean data to app

✔ Application Layer (HTTP)

Google’s server receives:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com


And prepares a response.

📨 STEP 4 — Google sends the HTTP response back

Google server creates:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<html> ... </html>


Then the same layering happens in reverse:

1. Application → HTTP
2. Transport → TCP segment
3. Network → IP packet
4. Data Link → Ethernet frame
5. Physical → signals

And it travels back through routers to your home.

🖥️ STEP 5 — Your browser gets the response

Your computer receives the bits → goes UP the layers:

Physical → Data Link → Network → Transport → Application

Finally your browser receives HTML.

The browser renders the webpage.

🎯 FINAL SUMMARY (Very Simple)
Layer	                              What it adds	                What it does
Application	                           HTTP data	                Meaningful content
Transport	                           TCP ports	                 Reliable delivery
Network	                              IP addresses	                 Routing across networks
Data Link	                           MAC addresses	             Local delivery
Physical	                             Signals	                 Actual movement of bits

✔ So, in ONE sentence:

Your HTTP request is wrapped inside TCP, wrapped inside IP, wrapped inside Ethernet, 
turned into bits → travels to Google → unwrapped back to HTTP → processed → response sent back the same way.
