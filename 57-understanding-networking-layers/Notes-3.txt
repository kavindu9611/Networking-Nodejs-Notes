📘 Networking Notes — MAC Address, IP Address & Port Numbers (Simple + Practical)

These notes explain in clear, simple terms why MAC, IP, and port numbers exist, 
where they are used, and how your HTTP request really travels.

🔹 1. Why do we need three different identifiers?
Purpose	                                    Identifier	                  Layer
Identify which application	               Port number	         Transport layer (TCP/UDP)
Identify which device on the internet	     IP address	               Network layer
Identify which network card on a LAN	     MAC address	           Data Link layer

Each solves a completely different problem.

🔹 2. What is a MAC Address?
✔ A MAC address is the physical address of your network card

Example:

A4-7C-1F-33-9B-22

✔ Where MAC is used?

ONLY inside your Local Network (LAN)
(your home WiFi, office network)

✔ Who uses MAC addresses?

Switches
Your network interface card (NIC)
WiFi access points

✔ Why MAC is needed?

Because IP addresses cannot be used on cables or WiFi signals.
The data link layer uses frames, and frames require MAC addresses to deliver data to the correct device physically.

📌 MAC = “Which device on this network should receive the frame?”
🔹 3. What is an IP Address?
✔ IP address identifies a device on the internet

Example:

192.168.1.50
203.45.67.123

✔ Where IP is used?

For routing packets across networks

Routers use IP to decide where packets travel globally

✔ IP = “Which computer in the world should receive the packet?”

🔹 4. What is a Port Number?
✔ Port numbers identify the application inside the computer.

Your laptop:
uses many apps at once (browser, Spotify, VSCode)
all need internet access
port numbers separate the traffic

✔ Ports are NOT physical

They are software-level identifiers.

Examples:
App/Protocol	Port
HTTPS	          443
HTTP	          80
SSH	              22
DNS               53

📌 Port = “Which application should receive this data?”

🔹 5. Why port numbers are required?

Imagine 2 browser tabs connect to the same website:

IP is same

Destination port is same (443)

How does your computer know which tab gets the response?

Because each tab gets a different source port:

Tab 1 → 50122
Tab 2 → 50988


The server sees them as two different connections.

🔹 6. How servers handle millions of users on port 443

Servers differentiate every user by a 4-tuple:

(Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port)


Example:

User A:

10.0.0.5:51123  →  93.184.216.34:443


User B:

10.0.0.8:60144  →  93.184.216.34:443


Different source ports → completely separate connections.

🔹 7. Full Step-by-Step: What happens when you visit https://example.com

Let’s break down the entire journey.

🧩 Step 1 — Browser creates the HTTP Request

Example:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

🧩 Step 2 — Transport Layer (TCP) adds:
Source Port: e.g., 50122
Destination Port: 443


Ports identify which app is sending the data.

🧩 Step 3 — Network Layer (IP) adds:
Source IP: your public IP
Destination IP: example.com server IP


IP identifies which computers are talking.

🧩 Step 4 — Data Link Layer (Ethernet/WiFi) adds:
Source MAC: your network card
Destination MAC: your router's MAC


MAC is used only inside your LAN.

🧩 Step 5 — Physical Layer

Everything becomes 0s and 1s, then electrical/light/radio signals.

🧩 Step 6 — Your router receives it

Router removes:

your MAC address

replaces it with its own MAC
Keeps:

your IP
your source port
Router sends the packet to the next router.

🧩 Step 7 — Internet routers

They only look at:

IP addresses

Not ports
Not MAC
Not HTTP

They route it toward the destination server.

🧩 Step 8 — At the server’s data center

Final switch uses MAC to deliver the frame to the correct server machine.

Server receives:

dest IP (its own IP)

dest port (443 → HTTPS)

source IP (you)

source port (your random port)

🧩 Step 9 — Server sends response back

Response flows back using:

Same 4-tuple

Same path in reverse

Your OS uses the source port to deliver the response to the correct browser tab.

🔹 8. Quick Summary (Keep This!)
✔ MAC Address

Used in LAN only
Identifies network card
Used by switches

✔ IP Address

Used on the internet
Identifies the computer
Used by routers

✔ Port Number

Used inside the computer
Identifies the application
Used by transport layer (TCP/UDP)

Together:

MAC → delivers frame inside LAN
IP → delivers packet across internet
Port → delivers data to correct app
