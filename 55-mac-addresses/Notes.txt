what would you do maybe 20 years ago or 30 years ago if you wanted to share
some amount of information between two computers?
So imagine this is your computer and you want to share some information with another computer.
So there might be this guy in your company.
For example, his name is Liam and this is his computer.
Now, Liam could be in your company or maybe in your building.
In your home.
Doesn't matter.
The point is, we have two computers, and now we want to share some amount of information between these
two computers.
So back in the old days when we didn't have technologies such as networking cables such as routers,
IP addresses, networking cards
But without those technologies invented, or maybe they were invented, but they're not as prevalent
as they are right now.
And I'm talking about maybe 20 years ago or 30 years ago, not maybe 100 years ago or 50 years ago,
just fairly recently, actually.
And those days, there was no connection between these two computers, right?
There was no network or anything to connect these two computers together.
It was just a computer.
It was just a CPU, a Ram, a storage, and that was pretty much it.
There was no networking card.
There was no networking cable connecting these two together.
So there was no connection between these two computers or any other two computers in the world when
these networking technologies were not invented.
So what you would do if you wanted to share information was like this.
You would have to use something physical, maybe a floppy disk.
You might remember it.
We don't use them right now.
I mean, I've never seen them in like maybe five, ten years.
I don't remember, but I haven't seen them in like forever.
But they were pretty prevalent maybe 20 years ago.
So you would have to use one of these devices, maybe a floppy disk, a CD, a DVD, a flash disk,
whatever.
You would have to pick one of these up, and then you would have to physically insert that floppy disk
into your computer, and then you would have to save that information, write that information onto
that floppy disk, maybe that image that you want to share.
And then you would have to pull it out and then walk all the way over to Liam's computer and put that
disk into Liam's computer, and then save that file off of that floppy disk onto his computer.
So this is what you would have to do if you wanted to share information between two computers.
So it could be an application, an image, PDF, a piece of message.
This is what you would have done back in the old days, maybe 20 years ago, 30 years ago now, if Liam
maybe was in another continent.
So you might be maybe in North America and Liam might be in Europe.
If you just wanted to share an image, you would have to board a plane.
You would have to buy another plane tickets, fly all the way over to Europe and then give Liam the
disk.
This is how you would have done it.
And you can imagine that this was not practical at all.
I mean, we would have two computers in the same company, and we would constantly want to share information
between these two computers.
It was super impractical to maybe hire someone to just move a floppy disk around all the time, or you
would have to stand up and walk all the way over.
It was just super impractical.
And this is how it was done a couple of years ago.

So what happened afterwards?
I mean, right now with the networking technologies in place.
So let's see how we would do it right now.
Let's see how we can now connect these two computers together.
So imagine this is your computer again.
And then this is Liam.
And imagine we have maybe a couple more people here in our company.
So Janet and Bob, and now we want to set up a way to make sharing information between these computers
in a much, much easier way than using a floppy disk or a USB or something like that.
So what we would do in this case is to first have to use a switch.
So switch is the basic the most basic thing in networking.
Well first is an Ethernet cable.
The most basic one is a cable which simply just moves bits around
But after cable, the most basic thing in a network is a switch.
Now if you're wondering to know how it looks, this is how a switch looks like.
So this is how we would set up a network.
You would first have to buy the cables which is the most basic form.
And then after you buy the cables you have to buy one of these switches.
And after you buy the switch, which is in this purest form, you would have to connect that switch
to your computer, your laptop, using a special cable that comes with the switch, and then you would
have to log into the switch and manually configure it.
Just like that, you would SSH into your servers and, you know, SSH into a computer and then configure
it.
You would have to I mean, you have to configure a switch when you buy it.
So you would have to configure how data is flowing in the switch.
The next step is to connect these computers together using that Ethernet cable, that image that we
just saw.
So we'd have to connect each one of these computers individually to that switch.
Now if you want to do this, if you want to use the cables, your computer needs to have an ability
to accept that Ethernet cable, which is a special type of cable.
And the way that your computer does that is using a networking card.
So nowadays when you buy a laptop, a MacBook, an iMac, the networking card comes built in with it,
and that networking card has a unique address associated with it, which is called a mac address.
So each one of these computers, assuming that they do have the networking card either built in or manually,
so previously, I mean, I don't remember how it's done if you want to assemble a PC, but maybe a couple
of years ago, if you would, if you were to buy a PC and assemble it yourself, you would also have
to buy a networking card and install that on your PC.
And right now, as I said before, all the computers, laptops, they that networking card comes built
in with them.

But if you imagine if you want to assemble one yourself totally from scratch, you would have to buy
that networking card yourself.
And also the first PCs that came in, I think maybe 30 years ago, I'm not quite sure they didn't have
the networking card built into them, so you would have to do it manually.
You would have to buy networking cards which had this Mac address on it, and then you would have to
install that on your machine.
So these networking cards have a unique Mac address burned on them.
So your Mac address might be this, Janet's might be this, Liam this and Bob this.
Your computer right now has this Mac address.
And by the way, these are real Mac addresses.
And by real I mean that they look real.
Mac address is 48 bits.
And the bits in this case are represented using hexadecimal.
So as we said before, whenever you see hexadecimal it just means zeros and ones.
Each hexadecimal character is four bits.
So we have 12 of these characters, which in total means 48 bits.

So now we have our computers and we have the switch.
And we also have cables.
And we also have these Mac addresses.
Now imagine that you want to send some amount information over to Bob's computer.
So what you would do in this case is that you would now send a packet.
So a packet looks like this.
Now when we're talking about switches we usually call them a frame.
But don't worry too much about the terminology.
We're just going to call them a packet.
And just a second I'm going to talk more about what is a packet and also what is a frame.
But basically right now let's just call it a piece of information.
And then we're going to talk about it later.
So if you want to send some amount of information, some amount of data over from your computer to maybe
Bob's computer, you would have to send one of these packets over to the switch.
And in this packet you have to specify some important information.
First of all you have to specify the source.
So you would have to say that this is me sending the information.
And you would also need to specify the destination Mac address like this.
And then also of course your piece of data that you want to send.
Now you would send this packet to the switch.
The switch is now configured.
It knows all the computers that are connected to it and their Mac addresses.
So it knows how to route this packet.
It takes a look at this destination which is f 131 and then the rest.
It checks all the computers and sees which one has this Mac address.
In this case it's Bob's.
So it's going to send this packet over to Bob's computer.
And now Bob receives this packet through its networking card.
So now its operating system could pull that information out and do whatever it wants with it.
So it could maybe write that piece of data.
It could extract this data and then write it to a file, or it could just display it on the screen.
It doesn't matter.
The point here is that now you could send some amount of information from one computer over to any other
computer that is connected to this switch, and we call this a network.
So this is how you would now set up a way to communicate between different computers in a much, much
easier way, comparing to using a floppy disk or using a USB.
It's much more efficient.
It's much, much faster.
You don't really have to get up off your seat and then walk over to a computer.
If you want to send some information to that computer, you would just have to issue these packets.
All you have to do is to just specify the source, which is something automatic.
It's unique to you.
So basically you just have to specify the destination and the data and that's it.
The switch will handle all the rest.
So the switch is configured.
It knows that each one of these inputs.
Years are the real world example of a switch.
It knows that each one of these inputs, for example input seven, corresponds to a specific Mac address.
So if a data packet arrives with that destination Mac address, it will just redirect it through that
input seven.
So the data will come out from this input seven, which is connected to that computer with that specific
Mac address.
So this is how you would now set up a very simple.
Network of different computers.
And just by knowing the Mac addresses, you could now send information back and forth.
